## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Reference prototype at `/home/renanl/Projects/snew-ai-core/` provides visual specification for all pages.
- Screenshots captured as `ref-*.png` serve as visual acceptance criteria.
- Brand DNA page is visual-only in this feature (mock data). Real analysis comes in Fase 1 CMO.
- Assumes `038-single-agent-skills` is merged (skills table exists).
